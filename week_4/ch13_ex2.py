# Exercise 2

# Suppose we have dictionary availability:
# keys: friendâ€™s name
# values: list of days they are available to play a game
# (a) Write a function that accepts an availability dictionary and returns a new dictionary mapping days to
# friends who can play that day.
# (b) Using the function from a):
# Find the day most friends can attend to play the game
# List who can and can not attend the session that day
