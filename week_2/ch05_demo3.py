# This demonstration shows you how to call methods on string objects.


# initialize some variables to play with
url = "www.engineering.usask.ca"

# find the location of the first period in the url



# find the location of the second period



# similar to .find(), we have .index()



# count the number of periods in the url



#----------------------------------------

# remove white space


# what if we want to remove all spaces


# count the number of characters in the url after removing "www."


# more methods:



# when are they useful?



# immutable, they create a copy


# how do I know what kind of methods are out there? How do I know the syntax/usage?
