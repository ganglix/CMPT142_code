# recursion
# "the family chain of new phones"


# problem solving - delegation metaphor
# 1 find the base case (easy)
# 2 find a way to reduce the problem (not easy): reduce steps of procedure, quantity of a number, size of a list
# 3 find the relationship between the solution of the reduced problem and the original problem
